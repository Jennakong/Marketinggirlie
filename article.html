            <h1>I Was 30 Minutes Late for My Job Interview—And Still Got Hired: 5 Key Strategies to Nail Your Next Interview</h1>

            <p>Job interviews can be nerve-wracking. Between the pressure to perform and the logistics of getting there on time, things don’t always go as planned. In my case, I ended up being 30 minutes late to an interview—and still got the job! Here’s how I turned a stressful situation into a success, and what you can learn from my experience to nail your next interview.</p>

            <p>If you’re currently on the job hunt, you’ll want to know the 5 key strategies I used to win over my interviewers (even after a late start!).</p>

            <h2>1. Do Your Research: “Show Me You Know Me”</h2>
            <p>One of the best pieces of advice I’ve ever received came from my current manager: "Show me you know me." This means doing your homework before the interview. Research the company thoroughly, understand their values, and, if possible, learn about the person interviewing you.</p>

            <p><strong>How does this help?</strong> Mentioning something you found on the company's website or LinkedIn shows you’re genuinely interested in them—not just the paycheck.</p>

            <h2>2. Customise Your Resume for Every Job</h2>
            <p>Sending out generic resumes is a big mistake. <strong>Tailor your resume</strong> for each specific role and company. This shows that you’ve taken the time to align your skills and experience with what they’re looking for.</p>

            <p>Even during the interview, you should tailor your answers to reflect the company’s needs. Talk about how your previous work experience and skills directly relate to the position.</p>

            <h2>3. Share Your Story—Don’t Be Shy!</h2>
            <p>In interviews, your <strong>personal story</strong> is your strength. Don’t hesitate to share your journey, but make sure to relate it to the position you're interviewing for. In my case, I shared how transitioning from teaching to marketing was challenging but gave me valuable skills like communication and problem-solving.</p>

            <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong> Storytelling makes you memorable. Your experiences and how you frame them can set you apart from other candidates.</p>

            <h2>4. Know What Makes You Unique</h2>
            <p>What’s your <strong>unique selling point</strong>? Whether it’s a specific skill, perspective, or experience, you need to identify what sets you apart. For me, my background in teaching gave me excellent communication skills that other candidates didn’t have. What makes you the perfect fit for the job?</p>

            <h2>5. Confidence is Key—But Stay Humble</h2>
            <p>Walk into the interview with <strong>confidence</strong>, but avoid arrogance. Confidence shows that you’re competent and ready for the role, but humility ensures you remain approachable. Employers want someone who can do the job and still be open to learning and growing.</p>

            <h2>Bonus Tip: Don’t Be Late</h2>
            <p>While I got lucky being late to this interview, it’s something you should avoid. Being late can make you seem unprofessional or unprepared. Always plan ahead and give yourself plenty of time to arrive early.</p>

            <p>Despite being late, these five strategies helped me secure the job. If you’re preparing for an interview, focus on <strong>research, customization, storytelling, confidence,</strong> and <strong>knowing what makes you unique</strong>. And most importantly—don’t be late!</p>
